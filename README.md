# Financial Modeling

This is a mobile web application that features 2 pages: The homepage and the details page. The homepage displays a list of symbols that have financial statements, and features a pagination bar that allows the user to limit the rendered results and a search bar that allows the user to filter by symbol. When the user clicks on any symbol, the website navigates to the details page, which contains the detailed Income Statement about that specific symbol. The data is consumed from [Financial Modeling Prep API](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/). Built with React, Redux, and Bootstrap.
